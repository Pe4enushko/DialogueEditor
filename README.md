# DialogueEditor
Made to convert text into JSON format as array of objects with text attributes: "Speaker","Text".
Raw text format (yes, not so raw now): 
1. Name - text
2. If that's narrative from nowhere then type $env as name 

Example:
Charlie - Hewwo uwu
That's a great day to add a line break into my speech.
Den - Hi. Well maybe yes.
$env - Sun was bright, wind was nice.
Den - Don't you think it's a great weather here?
Charlie - I prefer cloudy one.
